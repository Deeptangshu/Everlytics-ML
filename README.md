Justifications
<br>Comparison was done on multiple models to find what was a perfect fit for the prediction. 

<br>Precision alongside with good accuracy is important. For instance if hypothetically RFC got best accuracy but precision was found on Decision tree. We can't just compromise on the precision and let the model declare a phishing website as legitimate because that may prove to be dangerous for a user. But also, we don't want a model whose accuracy is low since we get very less output. What we need is a good amount of accurate output with good precision also.


Steps Followed:
1. Loading the dataset
2. Familiarizing with data
3. Visualizing data
4. Data Preprocessing and EDA
5. Hold Out validation
6. Model Building and Training (Decision Tree, Random Forest, MLP, XGB and SVM)
7. Comparison of Models
